# Mars Rover UI

Hi there!

This is the frontend for the Mars Rovers Kata, using WebSockets and VueJS.

## How to run

First make sure to run the backend API (see [Backend](../Reactor)'s readme for the instructions), then execute a `run dev` using NPM, Bun or whatever you prefer:

```shell
bun run dev
```

Then, go to http://localhost:5173 to start playing around with the Rover. Open multiple windows if you want another Rover to play with.
